# Logging in to DevInt Cluster

## GitHub Team Membership
Access to the cluster is controlled by membership in the
cluster-devint team of the openshift-knative GitHub
Organization. Every new user will need to get invited to this team.

Create an issue at
https://github.com/openshift-knative/cluster-devint/issues to request
access to this team and someone will invite you. A simple description
such as "I work on the foo team at Red Hat and would like access to
the openshift-knative devint cluster" will be enough for most cases. A
human will verify your provided details before approval.


## Web Console Access
Go to
https://console-openshift-console.apps.devint.openshiftknativedemo.org
and choose the `github` identity provider. Do the login dance with
your GitHub account.

## Command Line Access
After logging in to the web console, click the dropdown arrow next to
your name in the top right corner and click "Copy Login Command". That
will redirect you to another page where you click "Display Token" and
the correct `oc login` command will be shown for your user.

# Using the DevInt Cluster

Create a new project after logging in and deploy what you need. This
is a shared cluster and does not have unlimited resources, so play
nicely.

# Suggesting changes to the DevInt Cluster

The entire cluster is managed via [Argo
CD](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd) from this repository. If
you'd like a new operator installed on the cluster or anything else
that needs cluster administrator permission to do, file an issue or PR
in this repo with the desired change and someone will merge it after
reviewing.

Once merged the change will be live on the cluster within a few
minutes.

# DevInt Cluster Creation (only relevant for operations)

## Configure AWS CLI to use installer IAM credentials
```
aws configure --profile openshiftknativedemo-installer
AWS Access Key ID [None]: *****
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: *****
Default region name [None]: us-west-2
Default output format [None]:
```

## Create cluster
Using openshift-install 4.1.16, create the install config:

```
mkdir -p ~/Documents/openshift_clusters
cd ~/Documents/openshift_clusters

export AWS_PROFILE=openshiftknativedemo-installer

openshift-install create install-config --dir devint-openshiftknativedemo
```

For both control plane and compute nodes, set instance size to m5.xlarge:

```
  platform:
    aws:
      type: m5.xlarge
```

Now actually create the cluster:

```
openshift-install create cluster --dir devint-openshiftknativedemo --log-level info
```

## Populate Secrets
Download bitwarden CLI from https://help.bitwarden.com/article/cli/#download--install

Login to bitwarden the first time you use it:
```
bw login username@company.com password
```

Unlock the session and optionally pull the latest secrets if things have changed
```
export BW_SESSION=$(bw unlock password --raw)
bw sync # only needed if secrets updated server-side
./populate-secrets-from-bitwarden.sh
```



## Install Argo CD
```
oc create namespace argocd
oc apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v1.2.2/manifests/install.yaml
```

download the argocd CLI from https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v1.2.2


## Create the cluster-setup application to seed the cluster
```
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-knative/cluster-devint/c216b1ea884f0ff9dd9e91635d81c5c5ee35c285/seed.yaml
```

### Verify the cluster-setup application synced successfully
```
oc port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
argocd login localhost:8080 --insecure --username admin --password $(oc get pods -n argocd -l app.kubernetes.io/name=argocd-server -o name | cut -d'/' -f 2)

# make sure health status is healthy and sync status is synced
argocd app get cluster-setup
```
